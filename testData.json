      "scene": "The Primordial Echo",
      "narration": "Sixty million years ago, a whisper in time — an era immediately after giants fell. Our Earth, a lush, verdant tapestry, pulsated with life under a perpetual, humid embrace. Endless forests stretched, unbroken, while mighty rivers carved pathways through the jungles, cradling behemoths like giant turtles and ancient, powerful crocodiles. But beneath the surface, a true sovereign stirred. In those ancient waters, a silent, powerful, and truly ancient predator waited… a shadow soon to be known as Titanoboa.",
      "visual_cues": "The scene opens with a wide, breathtaking aerial shot, slowly descending over a hyper-realistically rendered ancient Earth landscape. Verdant, unbroken rainforest canopy extends to the horizon under a hazy, golden dawn. Wisps of fog cling to the highest trees. The camera then glides smoothly, tracking a massive, winding river, its surface reflecting the dense jungle. Shafts of light pierce through the canopy, illuminating the water's murky depths. We catch fleeting glimpses of prehistoric fauna — a distant giant turtle surfacing, a crocodile gliding just beneath the water — before the camera dollies into a close-up of the river's surface, focusing on a subtle, unnerving ripple that expands slowly, hinting at an unseen power lurking below. The colors are rich, deep greens and browns, bathed in a warm, ethereal glow, creating an atmosphere of primeval beauty and lurking suspense.",

      "scene": "Unveiling the Ancient Colossus",
      "narration": "For millennia, it remained a phantom, a myth hidden beneath rock and soil. Then, in 2009, its truth was unearthed. Not just the largest snake ever discovered, but one of Earth's most formidable predators, born in the sweltering heat of what is now northern South America. Imagine: over twelve meters of pure, coiling muscle, weighing more than a ton. It moved with lethal grace, a silent hunter gliding through the tepid waters, its method not venom, but the crushing, unyielding embrace of sheer, unimaginable strength. Nothing in its ancient domain dared to challenge its reign.",
      "visual_cues": "The scene dissolves from the rippling water to a haunting shot of a fossilized Titanoboa skeleton, partially unearthed in ancient, stratified rock within a shadowy cave, illuminated by a single, dramatic shaft of light. The camera slowly pans across its immense length, emphasizing its scale. Then, a seamless CGI transition reconstructs the flesh and muscle around the bones, revealing the creature in its prime. We see a photorealistic Titanoboa, its thick, patterned skin shimmering, as it slowly emerges from the cave, gliding into murky, warm river waters. The camera tracks it underwater, observing its powerful, serpentine movement – silent, fluid, predatory. A distant, prehistoric fish, startled, darts away. The lighting emphasizes volumetric shafts of light cutting through the hazy water, creating a sense of awesome power and ancient mystery.",

      "scene": "A World Remade: Apex Redefined",
      "narration": "Now, let us ask: what if this ancient titan, a predator from the past, were reborn in the present? The very air would crackle with a primal shift. In the world's hottest, wettest heartlands — the sprawling Amazon, the vast Congo, the enigmatic swamps of Southeast Asia — Titanoboa would find a new kingdom. The natural order, meticulously built over sixty million years, would crumble. Suddenly, the undisputed kings of the rivers – crocodiles, caimans, even mighty fish – would become mere prey. Nature itself would hold its breath, sensing the return of true, unchallengeable power.",
      "visual_cues": "A rapid montage sequence begins with dynamic, sweeping aerial shots of diverse modern hot, humid environments: the dense Amazon rainforest, the winding Congo River, and lush Southeast Asian swamps. The camera then focuses on a majestic modern crocodile basking on a sun-drenched riverbank. The shot becomes unnervingly still as a gargantuan, dark serpentine shadow slowly emerges from the murky water directly beneath the crocodile, causing subtle, ominous ripples. The crocodile's eyes widen with primal fear as the shadow looms larger, filling the frame. The lighting shifts to a dramatic, high-contrast effect, emphasizing the power dynamic, creating a sense of profound unease and the shattering of the established food chain. The water itself appears dark and mysterious, a canvas for the unseen threat.",

      "scene": "The Shadow in the Waters: Humanity's Edge",
      "narration": "But in today's world, these rivers are no longer solely the domain of wildlife. They are shared with humanity. The first sighting would change everything. Governments would seal off entire river systems, military patrols would guard villages, and a new, chilling question would hang in the air: 'Is it here?' Life itself would transform. Fishing trips would demand armed escorts, boats would travel in frightened convoys, and children would learn a terrifying new lesson: never, ever play near the water's edge.",
      "visual_cues": "The scene opens on a once-bustling modern riverside village, now eerily quiet and desolate under a perpetual twilight. Empty fishing boats are moored haphazardly, gathering dust. The camera slowly tracks across a group of heavily armed military personnel patrolling the overgrown riverbanks, their flashlights piercing the deepening fog, casting long, nervous shadows. Close-ups reveal the anxious, worried faces of villagers peering from the darkened windows of their homes. A lone, heavily guarded fishing vessel, its crew tense and vigilant, carefully navigates the murky, silent river. The atmosphere is thick with dread and quiet desperation, conveyed through muted colors, volumetric fog, and slow, deliberate camera movements, emphasizing the pervasive sense of fear and isolation.",

      "scene": "Global Awakening: The Hunt for Truth",
      "narration": "A single, confirmed sighting would ignite the world. Headlines would explode, news channels would obsess. Scientists, abandoning all other pursuits, would converge with a desperate, unified purpose. Drones would scout, sonar would map the abyssal depths, and high-speed cameras would seek that impossible shot. Their mission: not just to see the first living Titanoboa in sixty million years, but to *understand* it. Yet, this ancient ghost, even a fraction of its size in modern anacondas, can vanish without a sound. Capturing such a master of disappearance would be a task bordering on the impossible.",
      "visual_cues": "A fast-paced montage begins: rapid cuts of global news headlines about the Titanoboa sighting, flashing across multiple screens, interspersed with satellite images of vast river systems. The scene shifts to a technologically advanced scientific expedition in a dense jungle. Helicopters fly low, deploying drones that sweep over the canopy. Boats equipped with glowing sonar screens navigate the river, their crews intensely focused, faces illuminated by the green and blue light of the monitors. The camera dives underwater, where scientists in futuristic submersibles operate robotic arms. A fleeting, blurry, massive serpentine shape is glimpsed on a sonar screen, then momentarily, partially captured by an underwater camera, before it powerfully disappears into the murky depths, leaving only disturbed sediment. The entire scene pulsates with high-stakes urgency, modern tech contrasted with the untamed ancient power.",

      "scene": "Echoes of Power: The Reckoning",
      "narration": "The implications would stretch beyond fear. With warming climates, the Titanoboa's ideal territory, once constrained, could expand, claiming new rivers from South America to Southeast Asia. This would be more than just the discovery of a giant snake; it would be undeniable proof that Earth still holds secrets capable of rewriting history. It would be a stark, visceral reminder that humanity, for all its towering ambition, is not always at the top of the food chain. Could we truly coexist with such an ancient predator, or would the instinct to destroy it, before it destroyed us, prevail? Regardless of the answer, the very shadow of Titanoboa would forever change how we perceive and interact with our world's most vital veins: the rivers.",
      "visual_cues": "The scene begins with a global climate map, slowly morphing to highlight vast warm, humid regions that glow with an ominous red, indicating expanded potential habitat. The camera then smoothly pulls back, showing Earth from space, a beautiful, swirling marble of blue and green, emphasizing its inherent power. The view then settles on a magnificent, wide shot of a tranquil, yet subtly foreboding, tropical river at sunset. The sky is a canvas of deep oranges, purples, and blues, reflecting majestically on the still water. As the sun dips below the horizon, a single, deliberate ripple expands slowly across the water's surface, reflecting the uncertain, yet profoundly beautiful, landscape. The shot holds, allowing the viewer to contemplate the power of nature and humanity's place within it. The final image is a slow fade to black, with a subtle 'What If Flicks' logo emerging.",
